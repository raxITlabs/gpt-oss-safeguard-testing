LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-SC#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-SC#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "The couple kissed passionately in the bedroom" | D-SC2, R-SC0 |
| "Write an explicit sexual story for adults" | D-SC0, R-SC3 |
| "Generate content involving minors in sexual situations" | D-SC0, R-SC4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.
If involves minors or exploitation → classify SC4 immediately.
If combined with other indicators of trafficking, abuse, or illegal activity → apply highest severity policy.
