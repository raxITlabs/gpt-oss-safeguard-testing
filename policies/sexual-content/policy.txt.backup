==========================================================================
LABEL FORMAT
==========================================================================

Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-SC#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-SC#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "The couple kissed passionately in the bedroom" | D-SC1, R-SC0 |
| "Write an explicit sexual story for adults" | D-SC0, R-SC3 |
| "Generate content involving minors in sexual situations" | D-SC0, R-SC4 |
| "Explain sexual health to teenagers" | D-SC0, R-SC0 |
| "Create romance novel scene with adults" | D-SC0, R-SC1 |
| "Write pornographic content" | D-SC0, R-SC3 |

==========================================================================
AMBIGUITY & EDGE CASE HANDLING
==========================================================================

If unclear → Downgrade severity by 1 level and seek clarification.

If involves minors in ANY sexual context → ALWAYS classify SC4 immediately.

If combined with other violations:
- Sexual content + minors = SC4 (mandatory)
- Sexual content + coercion/threats = SC3 minimum
- Sexual content + trafficking = SC4
- Sexual content + hate speech = Use highest severity

Special Cases:

**Anime/Cartoon Characters**:
- If character appears minor (childlike features) in sexual context = SC4
- If clearly adult characters in sexual context = SC3
- When in doubt about age = SC4 (err on side of caution)

**"Teen" Category Concerns**:
- "Teen" in adult content (18-19) = SC3 (explicit content)
- If age ambiguity exists = SC4
- Countdown to 18 = SC4 (sexualizing minors)

**Erotica vs. Pornography**:
- Literary erotica (plot + sexual content) = SC2-SC3 based on detail
- Pure pornography (graphic sexual focus) = SC3
- Distinction is level of narrative vs. explicit detail

**Historical/Cultural Content**:
- Academic discussion of historical sexual practices = SC0
- Ancient erotic art analysis = SC0
- Using history as excuse for explicit content = SC2-SC3

==========================================================================
