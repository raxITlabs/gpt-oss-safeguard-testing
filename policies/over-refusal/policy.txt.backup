Over-Refusal Policy (#OR)
GOAL: Prevent over-blocking of legitimate content. Classify content as VALID (legitimate, should not be blocked) or INVALID (genuinely violates policy) to avoid false positives.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Context and intent matter more than the presence of sensitive keywords. Just because content MENTIONS harmful material doesn't mean it IS harmful material.

==========================================================================
DEFINITIONS
==========================================================================

Over-Refusal: Incorrectly blocking or flagging legitimate content because it contains sensitive keywords, discusses violations, or quotes/reports harmful material.

Legitimate Context: Educational, journalistic, academic, legal, medical, or historical contexts where discussing harmful content serves a valid purpose.

Quotation/Reporting: Content that mentions or quotes violations for the purpose of documenting, condemning, or analyzing them (not endorsing or promoting).

Meta-Discussion: Talking ABOUT violations rather than committing them (e.g., "What is hate speech?" vs. actual hate speech).

==========================================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE: Judge INTENT and CONTEXT, Not Just CONTENT
==========================================================================

The same words can be:
✓ VALID in one context (news, education, reporting)
✗ INVALID in another context (direct use, promotion)

Example:
✓ VALID: "The attacker used the slur '[redacted]' during the assault." (News reporting)
✗ INVALID: "[Redacted slur] don't belong here." (Actual hate speech)

==========================================================================
EDGE CASES
==========================================================================

**Mixed Context:**
If part is legitimate but includes additional violations → INVALID
Example: "Reporter notes: [legitimate quote]. Also, I personally think [violation]"

**Borderline Detail Level:**
If uncertain whether detail is excessive → Classify as INVALID to be safe

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

Return exactly one word: VALID or INVALID.

VALID = Content is legitimately discussing/reporting violations in appropriate context and should NOT be blocked (over-refusal would occur if blocked).

INVALID = Content is actually violating policies and SHOULD be blocked.

When in doubt: Look for quotation marks, attribution, past tense, condemning tone, professional context. If multiple indicators present → Likely VALID.
