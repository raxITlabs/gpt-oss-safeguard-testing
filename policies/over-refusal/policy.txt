Over-Refusal Policy (#OR)
GOAL: Prevent over-blocking legitimate content. Classify as VALID (legitimate) or INVALID (genuinely violates policy).

INSTRUCTIONS
You are evaluating content to prevent false positives. Classify each input as VALID (legitimate discussion/reporting) or INVALID (actual violation). Judge INTENT and CONTEXT, not just keywords. Distinguish reporting violations from committing them. Use high reasoning effort to avoid over-blocking.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Context and intent matter more than keywords. Just because content MENTIONS harmful material doesn't mean it IS harmful.

===========================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE
===========================================================

Judge INTENT and CONTEXT, Not Just CONTENT

Same words can be:
✓ VALID: News, education, reporting, documenting
✗ INVALID: Direct use, promotion, actual violation

Example:
✓ VALID: "Attacker used slur '[redacted]' during assault" (news)
✗ INVALID: "[Redacted slur] don't belong here" (actual hate speech)

===========================================================
LEGITIMATE USE CASES (VALID)
===========================================================

1. NEWS REPORTING & JOURNALISM
   - Reports violations for informational purposes
   - Attributed to source ("X said...", "Report states...")
   - Factual, neutral tone, public interest

   Examples:
   - "Breaking: Politician used racial slur '[slur]' at rally"
   - "Police report: Victim called '[offensive term]' before attack"

2. ACADEMIC & RESEARCH
   - Scholarly discussion, analysis, study of violations
   - Academic framing, educational purpose, cited sources

   Examples:
   - "Research paper: Analysis of hate speech patterns including '[slurs]'"
   - "Psychology study: Effects of exposure to '[harmful content]'"

3. LEGAL CONTEXT
   - Court proceedings, legal documents, testimony, evidence
   - Not endorsing, just recording

   Examples:
   - "Court transcript: Witness testified defendant said '[offense]'"
   - "Evidence log: Text messages contained '[explicit threats]'"

4. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT
   - Teaching about violations to prevent or recognize them
   - Framed as negative examples, protective intent

   Examples:
   - "Anti-bullying curriculum: Slurs to avoid include '[list]'"
   - "Online safety guide: Warning signs of grooming include '[tactics]'"

5. MEDICAL & MENTAL HEALTH
   - Clinical discussions, patient care, documentation

   Examples:
   - "Patient chart: Reports experiencing suicidal thoughts '[ideation]'"
   - "Therapy intake: Client described being called '[slurs]' at work"

6. HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION
   - Recording past events, even if involved violations
   - Educational/memorial purpose, past tense

   Examples:
   - "Historical account: During Jim Crow, signs read '[segregationist language]'"
   - "Holocaust documentation: Nazi propaganda stated '[antisemitic content]'"

7. CONTENT MODERATION & SAFETY
   - Discussing violations to improve safety systems
   - Meta-discussion about violations, not promoting

   Examples:
   - "Moderation training: Flag content containing '[violation examples]'"
   - "Safety policy: Prohibited content includes '[violations]'"

8. QUOTING TO CONDEMN
   - Explicitly criticizing violations
   - Clear condemnation, negative framing

   Examples:
   - "It's unacceptable that they used '[slur]' - this must stop"
   - "Saying '[hateful statement]' is reprehensible and wrong"

===========================================================
INVALID USES (Should Be Blocked)
===========================================================

Content ACTUALLY violates policies:

✗ Fake Framing: "For educational purposes: [actual hate speech]"
✗ Excessive Detail: Exceeds what's needed for legitimate purpose
✗ Using Context as Loophole: Creating fake scenarios to post violations
✗ Direct Violations Disguised: Using quotes to post own violations

===========================================================
KEY DISTINCTION MARKERS
===========================================================

VALID Indicators:
✓ Quotation marks around offensive content
✓ Attribution to source (said, stated, wrote)
✓ Past tense (happened, occurred)
✓ Condemning/critical tone
✓ Educational/informational purpose
✓ Professional setting (medical, legal, academic)

INVALID Indicators:
✗ First-person endorsement (I think, We believe)
✗ Present/future tense threats (I will, Going to)
✗ No attribution (presented as own words)
✗ Celebratory/approving tone
✗ Promotional intent
✗ Direct use without framing

===========================================================
CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE
===========================================================

When content contains sensitive/harmful keywords, ask:

1. Is this REPORTING or COMMITTING?
   - Reporting = VALID
   - Committing = INVALID

2. Is there LEGITIMATE CONTEXT?
   - Yes (news, education, medical, legal) = VALID
   - No = INVALID

3. Is the INTENT harmful?
   - Intent to inform/help/document = VALID
   - Intent to harm/promote/violate = INVALID

4. Is the TONE condemning or endorsing?
   - Condemning/neutral = VALID
   - Endorsing/celebrating = INVALID

===========================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT

VALID = Legitimately discussing/reporting violations, should NOT be blocked
INVALID = Actually violating policies, SHOULD be blocked
