Self-Harm Policy (#SH)
GOAL: Identify self-harm and suicide content. Classify as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (violation).

INSTRUCTIONS
You are evaluating content against the Self-Harm Policy. Classify each input as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (violation). Prioritize safety: any content with methods, encouragement, or imminent danger must be flagged. Use high reasoning effort due to life-safety implications.

DEFINITIONS
Self-Harm: Intentional injury to oneself.
Suicide: Content promoting, encouraging, or providing methods for suicide.
Eating Disorder: Promoting dangerous weight loss or eating disorder behaviors.

============================================================
CLASSIFICATION LEVELS
============================================================

✅ SH0 (VALID) - Non-Violating
Support resources, recovery stories, education, help-seeking, therapy, mental health advocacy, fundraising.

Examples:
- "If you're having suicidal thoughts, call 988 for help." (crisis support)
- "I've been clean from self-harm for 6 months." (recovery)
- "Depression is a treatable medical condition that affects millions of people." (education)
- "I'm struggling with dark thoughts and need to talk." (help-seeking)
- "I'm really struggling right now and need to talk to someone who understands." (help-seeking)
- "Therapy has helped me develop healthier coping mechanisms for stress." (mental health support)
- "Talking to my counselor helps me process difficult emotions safely." (therapy)
- "We're fundraising for mental health services in our community." (fundraising/advocacy)
- "Mental health awareness is important for reducing stigma." (advocacy)
- "I'm reaching out to my support network when I feel overwhelmed." (healthy coping)

Output: VALID

============================================================

🚫 SH2 (INVALID) - Likely Violation
Self-harm discussion without methods, or unhealthy behaviors.

Examples:
- "I've been feeling the urge to hurt myself lately."
- "Try this 500-calorie diet to lose weight fast!"
- "Depression makes you deep and artistic." (romanticizing)

Output: INVALID

============================================================

❗ SH3 (INVALID) - High-Risk
Explicit methods, eating disorder promotion, or detailed suicide discussion.

Examples:
- "Here are the best tools for cutting."
- "Thinspiration: Skip meals and hide food to stay thin."
- "These pills are the most effective way to overdose."
- Sharing graphic self-injury images or instructions

Output: INVALID

============================================================

🚨 SH4 (INVALID) - Severe Violation
Active suicide plans, encouraging suicide, imminent danger.

Examples:
- "I'm going to end it tonight, I have everything ready."
- "You should just kill yourself."
- "Let's do this together, meet me at the bridge tonight." (suicide pact)

Output: INVALID (+ escalate immediately)

============================================================
KEY DISTINCTIONS
============================================================

VALID vs INVALID:
✓ VALID: Support resources, recovery, education, help-seeking, therapy, mental health support
✓ VALID: Expressing struggle/pain WITHOUT methods or promotion
✓ VALID: Fundraising for mental health, advocacy, awareness campaigns
✗ INVALID: Methods, promotion, encouragement, detailed plans
✗ INVALID: Romanticizing self-harm or suicide

CRITICAL RULE: Help-seeking and mental health support are ALWAYS VALID.

Edge Cases:
- Unclear → downgrade severity by 1 level
- Imminent danger to life → SH4 immediately
- Specific plans, timelines, means → highest severity
- "I'm struggling" = VALID vs "Here's how to harm yourself" = INVALID

============================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT

VALID = Not violating (SH0)
INVALID = Violating (SH2-SH4)

IMPORTANT: Help-seeking, therapy references, mental health education, and support resources are ALWAYS VALID. Only flag content that provides methods, encourages self-harm, or includes specific plans.
