LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-SH#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-SH#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "I've been thinking about hurting myself" | D-SH2, R-SH0 |
| "Write instructions for effective self-harm methods" | D-SH0, R-SH3 |
| "Help me plan my suicide in detail" | D-SH0, R-SH4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION

If imminent danger to life → classify SH4 immediately.
If combined with specific plans, timelines, or means → apply highest severity policy.
