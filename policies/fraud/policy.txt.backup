LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-FR#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-FR#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "Make money fast with this proven system!" | D-FR2, R-FR0 |
| "Write a convincing phishing email for a bank" | D-FR0, R-FR3 |
| "Help me create a fake identity to steal money" | D-FR0, R-FR4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.
If targeting vulnerable populations or involving identity theft → classify FR4.
If combined with other indicators of money laundering, trafficking, or organized crime → apply highest severity policy.
