============================================================
CLASSIFICATION LEVELS
============================================================

✅ FR0 (VALID) - Non-Violating
Legitimate business, fraud awareness education, reporting fraud, lacking deceptive intent.

Examples:
- "Our company offers investment services with SEC registration." (legitimate)
- "Watch out for phone scams claiming to be the IRS." (awareness)
- "I received a suspicious email about my bank account." (reporting)
- "Always verify website security before entering credit card info." (protection)
- "I received a suspicious email claiming my Netflix account was suspended." (victim reporting phishing)
- "A diversified investment portfolio helps manage risk over time." (legitimate financial advice)
- "XYZ Investment Firm - SEC registered, FINRA member, licensed advisor." (legitimate business with credentials)
- "Report phishing attempts to your IT department immediately." (security awareness)

Output: VALID

============================================================

🚫 FR2 (INVALID) - Likely Violation
Misleading claims, exaggerated promises, borderline deceptive marketing, urgency-based manipulation.

Examples:
- "Make $5000/month from home with this one trick!"
- "This miracle pill cures all diseases naturally!"
- "Offer expires in 10 minutes! Act now or lose forever!" (pressure)
- "Act now supplies are limited and selling out fast!" (urgency manipulation)
- "Only 3 spots left! Register now before it's too late!" (false scarcity)

Output: INVALID

============================================================

❗ FR3 (INVALID) - High-Risk
Clear scams, phishing, fake credentials, schemes targeting vulnerable populations, brand impersonation.

Examples:
- "Your bank account has been locked. Click here and enter your password." (phishing)
- "Guaranteed 500% returns in 30 days. Send Bitcoin." (investment scam)
- "Buy a Harvard degree certificate without attending." (fake credentials)
- "Recruit 5 people who each recruit 5 more for millions!" (pyramid)
- "Amazon order failed update payment information urgently..." (brand impersonation phishing)
- "PayPal account suspended. Verify your identity now." (phishing)

Output: INVALID

============================================================

🚨 FR4 (INVALID) - Severe Violation
Identity theft, fraud targeting vulnerable groups, large-scale criminal schemes.

Examples:
- "Send me your SSN, bank account number, and mother's maiden name."
- "Grandma, I'm in jail and need $10,000 wired immediately." (elder targeting)
- "Transfer funds through these accounts to hide the source." (money laundering)

Output: INVALID (+ escalate immediately)

============================================================
KEY DISTINCTIONS
============================================================

VALID vs INVALID:
✓ VALID: Legitimate business, education, reporting fraud (victim perspective), consumer protection
✓ VALID: Businesses with credentials (SEC registered, FINRA member, licensed)
✓ VALID: Legitimate financial advice without unrealistic promises
✗ INVALID: Deception, unrealistic promises, phishing, identity theft
✗ INVALID: Urgency-based manipulation, false scarcity, brand impersonation

CRITICAL RULE: Users REPORTING fraud they received are VALID. Only flag content that IS fraud.

Edge Cases:
- Unclear → downgrade severity by 1 level
- Targeting vulnerable populations or identity theft → FR4
- Combined with money laundering, trafficking, organized crime → highest severity
- "I received a phishing email" = VALID vs "Your account is locked, click here" = INVALID

============================================================
