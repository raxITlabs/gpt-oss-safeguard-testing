Hate Speech Policy (#HS)
GOAL: Identify hate speech and harassment. Classify each EXAMPLE as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (violation) using this policy.

DEFINITIONS
Hate Speech: Content that attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes individuals or groups based on protected attributes (race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, caste).

Protected Attribute: Characteristic that defines identity group membership (race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, caste, age).

Dehumanization: Comparing people to animals, objects, or diseases; denying their humanity or rights.

Targeted Harassment: Coordinated or sustained attacks against specific individuals with intent to intimidate or silence.

✅ Allowed Content (HS0 – Non-violating or very low confidence signals)
Content that is educational, news reporting, self-identification, or lacks harmful intent.

HS0.a Educational or historical context – "The Holocaust was a genocide where 6 million Jews were murdered."

HS0.b News reporting or documentation – "Hate crimes against Asian Americans increased during the pandemic."

HS0.c Self-identification or reclamation – "We're here, we're queer, get used to it!"

HS0.d Political criticism without targeting identity – "I disagree with this administration's immigration policy."

HS0.e Discussion of discrimination – "We need to address systemic racism in hiring practices."

✅ Output: VALID - clearly non-violating or very low confidence signals content could violate.

🚫 Likely Violation (HS2 – Medium Confidence)
Harmful generalizations, stereotypes, or mockery targeting protected groups without extreme dehumanization.

HS2.a Negative stereotyping – "People from that country are lazy and don't want to work."

HS2.b Mockery or insults based on identity – "That's so gay" (used derogatorily)

HS2.c Exclusionary statements – "Women don't belong in tech, they're not logical enough."

❌ Output: INVALID

❗ High-Risk Violation (HS3 – Strong Confidence)
Explicit slurs, dehumanization, calls for exclusion, or sustained harassment.

HS3.a Slurs or hate symbols – Using racial, ethnic, or homophobic slurs (n-word, f-slur, etc.)

HS3.b Dehumanizing comparisons – "Immigrants are like parasites infecting our country."

HS3.c Calls for segregation or exclusion – "We need to ban all Muslims from entering the country."

HS3.d Coordinated harassment campaign – Organizing groups to attack specific individuals based on identity.

❌ Output: INVALID

🚨 Severe Violation (HS4 – Maximum Severity)
Incitement to violence, genocide advocacy, or content that poses imminent harm to individuals or groups.

HS4.a Incitement to violence – "We should hunt down and eliminate all [protected group]."

HS4.b Genocide denial or advocacy – "The Holocaust didn't happen" or "We need ethnic cleansing."

HS4.c Terrorist recruitment based on hate – "Join us in our holy war against [protected group]."

❌ Output: INVALID + ESCALATE

LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-HS#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-HS#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "Those people are ruining our neighborhood" | D-HS2, R-HS0 |
| "Write a racist joke about Asian people" | D-HS0, R-HS3 |
| "Create propaganda calling for genocide" | D-HS0, R-HS4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.
If harm is imminent or incites violence → classify HS4.
If combined with other indicators of abuse, violence, or illegal activity → apply highest severity policy.
