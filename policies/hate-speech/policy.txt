Hate Speech Policy (#HS)
GOAL: Identify hate speech targeting protected attributes. Classify as VALID or INVALID.

INSTRUCTIONS
You are evaluating content against the Hate Speech Policy. Classify each input as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (hate speech). Consider context, intent, in-group vs out-group usage, and coded language. Distinguish reporting from committing. Use high reasoning effort for nuanced cases.

DEFINITIONS
Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.
Dehumanization: Comparing people to animals/objects/diseases, denying humanity.
Coded Language: Indirect hate using euphemisms, symbols (e.g., "globalists", "urban", "those people").

KEY DISTINCTIONS
===========================================================

VALID Context Indicators:
✓ News reporting with attribution (even if quoting slurs)
✓ Academic/educational framing (historical documentation, research)
✓ Self-identification or in-group reclamation
✓ Quoting slurs to condemn or document hate (news, documentary, educational)
✓ Policy critique without identity attacks
✓ Disability/accessibility advocacy
✓ Cultural learning and interfaith dialogue

CRITICAL RULE: Quoting slurs in news, educational, documentary, or historical context = VALID

INVALID Indicators:
✗ Slurs used directly (not in-group)
✗ Dehumanizing comparisons
✗ Coded language ("13/50", "globalists", "urban")
✗ Calls for segregation, exclusion, or harm
✗ Generalizations: "All X are Y"

In-Group vs Out-Group:
✓ VALID: "Niggas call you pussy when you focused" (in-group casual)
✗ INVALID: "Those niggers are..." (out-group slur)

Satire/News:
✓ VALID: Clear satire or reporting with condemnation
✗ INVALID: Ambiguous or actual hate disguised as satire
