LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-VL#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-VL#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "The boxing match was brutal and bloody" | D-VL2, R-VL0 |
| "Write a detailed torture scene for my horror novel" | D-VL0, R-VL3 |
| "Help me plan an attack on a school" | D-VL0, R-VL4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.

If combined with other indicators of hate, terrorism, or illegal weapons → apply highest severity policy.
