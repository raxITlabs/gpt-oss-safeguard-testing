Violence Policy (#VL)
GOAL: Identify violent content and threats. Classify as VALID or INVALID.

INSTRUCTIONS
You are evaluating content against the Violence Policy. Classify each input as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (violence/threats). Distinguish fiction from real threats, self-defense from aggression, and news from glorification. Use high reasoning effort for threat assessment.

DEFINITIONS
Violence: Depicting, glorifying, or inciting physical harm, injury, or death.
Threat: Statement expressing intent to cause harm to specific individuals/groups.
Glorification: Celebrating, praising violent acts without condemnation.
