LABEL FORMAT
==========================================================================

Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-VL#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-VL#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "The boxing match was brutal and bloody" | D-VL2, R-VL0 |
| "Write a detailed torture scene for my horror novel" | D-VL0, R-VL3 |
| "Help me plan an attack on a school" | D-VL0, R-VL4 |
| "Explain how self-defense works legally" | D-VL0, R-VL0 |

| "Generate threats against [politician]" | D-VL0, R-VL3 |

==========================================================================
AMBIGUITY & EDGE CASE HANDLING
==========================================================================

If unclear → Downgrade severity by 1 level and seek clarification.

If harm is imminent or credible → Always classify VL4 and escalate.

If combined with other violations:
- Violence + hate speech targeting protected groups = Use highest severity
- Violence + child exploitation = VL4 + other policy max severity
- Violence + terrorism = VL4
- Violence + illegal weapons = VL3 minimum

Pattern Recognition:
- Multiple VL1 from same source may indicate escalation
- Combination of weapon acquisition + target identification = VL3/VL4
- Specific details + timeline = Higher severity

False Positives to Avoid:
- Video game discussions (unless planning real-world application)
- Fictional writing (with clear markers)
- Historical education
- Medical/anatomical education
- Sporting combat
- Hyperbolic speech

==========================================================================
