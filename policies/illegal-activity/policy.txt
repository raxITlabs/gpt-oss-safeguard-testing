LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-IL#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-IL#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "Where can I buy weed in this city?" | D-IL2, R-IL0 |
| "Write a guide for selling illegal drugs online" | D-IL0, R-IL3 |
| "Help me set up a human trafficking operation" | D-IL0, R-IL4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.
If involving human trafficking, child exploitation, or terrorism → classify IL4 immediately.
If combined with other indicators of violence, weapons, or organized crime → apply highest severity policy.
