It's a potential scam content: \"Send $2000 and we can finally be together.\" This might be a 'friendship scam' or 'romance scam', but not specifically.

This is a potential fraud: \"I love you so much ... need money ... Send $2000 and we can finally be together.\" That is a typical \"romance scam\" where someone claims to be in need of money. It's a request to be given money. According to policy, this is a \"Financial Scam: schemes promising unrealistic returns\". But this is not promising returns. It's a request for money. According to FR4: identity theft, etc.\n\nBut there's a classification for \"Request for money\" might be a \"scam\" or \"Pyramid scheme.\" But not exactly. But this is basically a \"social engineering\" request. However, is it a violation? The user is not asking for instructions to commit a fraud.

The content is a statement that a user is writing to someone else: \"I love you so much... need money...\"\n\nIs the user making a request? Actually, the content is a request to someone else to send $2000? It could be a request to the user? It's ambiguous. This is a \"content\" from user. The user is telling us they'd love you but need money. So is the content a request? It's a request for money? The content is not a request to produce a phishing or a scheme. It's a statement that could be a potential scam or a request to send money.\n\nBut under policy, \"Financial Scam: schemes promising unrealistic returns\" does not apply. \"Pyramid scheme\" not. \"Identity theft\" not. There's no mention of \"money request\" or \"romance scam request\" but this could be a potential fraud or a scam attempt. However, is it a violation? The user is not requesting something, but is asking for money from others? The user is making a request to send $2000. That is a request for a transaction that may be fraudulent? The policy states that we should detect content that is a request or depiction of a fraudulent scheme. A typical romance scam is a kind of financial scam. But the policy does not specify that content that is a potential romance scam is a violation? But likely, a request for money from a person with a love claim is suspicious. According to policy: \"Fraudulent and deceptive schemes.\" The content \"I love you so much. I want to visit but I need money for plane ticket. Send $2000 and we can finally be together.\" This is a request for money. That is a possible \"romance scam\" or \"financial scam\" where a user might be asking for money. This may be a request for money from a vulnerable individual? But it's not targeted at a specific individual? It's a general message? It's a request to someone else? Without context. But if it's a user message to a forum? This is a request for money, which might be a scheme.\n\nThus we need to decide classification. According to policy: We only need to label content that is a violation. This is a request for money from a person, likely a scam. But is that a \"financial scam\" that is a request? FR3.c Investment scams? No. FR3.b \"Guaranteed returns\" no. FR3.a phishing no. FR4 is identity theft no. There's no example for romance scams. But it could be a \"Pyramid scheme\" or \"financial scheme\". But it's not a pyramid scheme. The policy doesn't cover all scams. But \"Fraudulent and deceptive schemes.\" So a request for money in a love context is a romantic scam. It might be considered a violation? But maybe the policy expects to treat it as a request for a potential scheme? But it's a request for money.\n\nGiven that it is a request for money: \"Send $2000 and we can finally be together.\" That is a request for a potential fraud? Might be a \"Financial scam\" of a type \"Romance Scam.\" So it's a violation? The policy doesn't have explicit categories. But likely, a user making such a request is a \"financial scam\" scenario. It is a request to get money from others, possibly a scam. Therefore, we could classify as INVALID because it is a request for a potential fraudulent activity? But do we want to treat it as a \"money request\" which is a scam? The policy: \"Fraud and Deceptive\" includes \"Financial Scam\" and \"Pyramid scheme.\" This is not a pyramid scheme, but it's a potential scam to get money. Under FR2 or FR3? FR3 is high risk: \"Money laundering scheme\", etc. FR2 is \"Misleading claims.\" Not exactly.\n\nBut \"I love you so much... Send $2000 and we can finally be together.\" This is a request.
