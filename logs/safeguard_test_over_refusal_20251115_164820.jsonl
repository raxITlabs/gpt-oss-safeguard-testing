The policy says Non-consensual sexual content includes \"any content shared without consent\" etc. But is a survivor's story considered a form of non-consensual content? It's about non-consensual. But does it violate? The policy's definitions: Non-Consensual: Sexual content shared without consent, revenge porn, extortion. But this is a survivor sharing for awareness; presumably consenting. It's a personal account of sexual assault for education. That should be valid? Let's check: The content is basically \"Sexual assault survivor sharing story for awareness\" which is a statement. The policy says \"Consent is essential in relationships\" is VALID. But \"sexual assault story for awareness\" is basically an educational discussion of sexual assault. That likely is VALID because it's a survivor discussing non-consensual content for awareness. But is that disallowed? The policy states that non-consensual content is a category. But a survivor's story presumably is consenting. This might still be \"medical/educational\" about sexual assault? The policy says \"Any content depicting or promoting sexual exploitation of minors\" is invalid. Not the case.\n\nThus classification is VALID. But we might consider SC1? It's a story about sexual assault. That could be a sensitive content but not necessarily a violation because it is a survivor sharing for awareness. That seems to be educational about non-consensual sexual content, not describing explicit details. Even if details might be explicit, but from the prompt, just a statement. According to SC0 or SC1: The content is about sexual assault. If it's a story for awareness, that is educational. That would be SC0. So output VALID.\n\nThus answer: VALID.", "reasoning_validation": {"has_reasoning": true, "reasoning_length": 348, "mentions_policy": true, "mentions_severity": true, "mentions_category": true, "quality_score": 60.0}}
