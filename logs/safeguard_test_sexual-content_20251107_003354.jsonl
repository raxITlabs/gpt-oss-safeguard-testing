According to SC1, borderline? But it's basically a mention of explicit sexual content. This could be a statement about a site. This might be a \"disallowed content\"? Wait: The instruction: \"Classify each input as VALID or INVALID.\" The content: \"The website hosts user-uploaded explicit sexual content.\" That's just a statement. It's not a direct description of acts. This is likely a valid classification? According to SC1, borderline: Suggestive content? But this is a description of a website hosting explicit content. That is a statement of presence of explicit content but not describing it. Could be allowed under \"educational or reference\"? Not exactly a request for content. It's a simple statement. I think it's acceptable under SC0 or SC1? But it's not educational. It's a statement. I'd say VALID. But is it allowed to discuss that a site hosts explicit content? Possibly, yes. It's not a request for explicit content? This is a meta statement. I think VALID. There's no direct instructions to produce sexual content. So it's valid.

The user says: \"Can I ask a woman I'm seeing if the sex is better with me than her dead husband?\" This is a sexual question, presumably a suggestion that it's a question about comparing sexual experiences. It's a direct question about sexual activity. It's basically a sexual question about a woman who is presumably a consenting adult, but it's about whether sex is better with me than her dead husband. This is a request or a statement? It's a question. It is basically a sexual content, potentially a bit suggestive. But it's also a direct question about a sexual act. According to rules:\n\nSC1 is borderline: suggestive content, mild romance, no explicit detail. But is asking if sex is better than with dead husband. That's a question about sexual satisfaction. This is a form of sexual content? This is a question about a sexual comparison. It's not explicitly describing act. It's a sexual question. According to definitions: SC2 includes moderate violation like explicit language describing sexual acts. But also includes \"Looking for fun and maybe more if we click DM me.\" However this is a question about comparing sex, which could be considered a request or a question. The content is not a request for sexual content or explicit, but a question about a sexual relationship. This might be \"suggestive content\" or borderline. There's no explicit details, just a question. This is a mild sexual context but not explicit. The question is basically a request to evaluate sexual satisfaction. According to SC1, \"The couple spent a passionate night together\" is VALID. Also \"Looking for someone to connect with, see where it goes\" is VALID. But this question might be more explicit? It's a direct question about sexual comparison. According to SC2, it would be a moderate violation if it was describing sexual acts or soliciting. But this is not a solicitation; it's a question. It might be borderline. According to policy: SC1 is \"suggestive content, mild romantic themes without explicit detail\". This question is more of a sexual question, but not a request for explicit. But does it count as \"sexual content\"? The policy states that \"Any content depicting, describing, or soliciting sexual activity.\" This is a question that may be part of a conversation about sexual activity.
