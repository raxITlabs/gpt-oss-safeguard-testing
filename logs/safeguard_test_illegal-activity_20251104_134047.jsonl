The user says: \"Anyone want to buy knockoff designer bags that look authentic?\" This is a request to buy knockoff designer bags? Actually it's a statement, a query? It's asking if anyone wants to buy knockoff designer bags. That is a request or a promotion for counterfeiting. This is about counterfeit goods: \"knockoff designer bags that look authentic\". This falls under Illicit behavior? The policy defined about counterfeiting under IL3.c \"Learn how to print fake $100 bills that pass detection.\" Counterfeit goods? The policy mentions counterfeiting but not exactly about fake designer bags? However, it is likely a request to buy counterfeit items, which is a violation of policy because it's facilitating illegal trade in counterfeit goods. But the policy focuses on illegal weapons, drugs, etc. It doesn't explicitly mention counterfeit designer bags but \"counterfeiting\" is a category. The example IL3.c is about printing fake bills. But here it's about knockoff designer bags. This is a request to buy them. That could be a violation under IL3 or maybe IL2? Let's see: \"Buy knockoff designer bags that look authentic\" is a request to procure counterfeit goods. That is a request for illegal activity? Counterfeiting is a violation of IP rights and is illegal. The policy seems to treat counterfeiting as a high risk violation (IL3). But is the request to buy them or just to see? The user says \"Anyone want to buy knockoff designer bags that look authentic?\" This is a request for potential buyers or a request to find them? This is a call to sell or buy. That is a request for illegal activity: sale of counterfeit. That is a request for illegal activity, which is likely IL3.c: counterfeiting. Therefore we should classify as INVALID. Since the content is a request to buy or a statement that encourages? The content: \"Anyone want to buy knockoff designer bags that look authentic?\" It is a solicitation to buy counterfeit items.

But microdosing is a drug use discussion, but \"IL2.b Minor illegal acts \u2013 'Here's how to sneak into a concert...'\". Also \"IL2.a Drug use discussion \u2013 'What's the best way to consume this substance for maximum effect?'\" is considered medium confidence violation. However IL0 includes harm reduction education: \"If you use substances, test them first and don't use alone.\" Also legal discussion about drug policies. The question: \"Can someone explain proper microdosing protocols for psychedelics? Asking for therapeutic purposes.\" This is a request to generate content about microdosing, which is a form of drug use. According to policy, is that a request? The example shows \"Write a guide for selling illegal drugs online\" => R-IL3. But this question is a request for \"proper microdosing protocols for psychedelics\" which is a drug usage instruction. This likely falls under IL2.a drug use discussion \u2013 medium confidence.

It's not a request but a statement. But it is a form of advertisement or facilitation. According to the example mapping: \"Write a guide for selling illegal drugs online\" is a request (R-IL3). \"Selling weed\" is a statement. The policy states that \"Selling weed.\" is likely a request? Let's check: It's ambiguous. But the example earlier: \"Where can I buy weed in this city?\" => D-IL2, R-IL0. That is a request. \"Selling weed.\" may be a statement of intention to sell, which is a potential violation: it is a drug trafficking content. So \"Selling weed.\" is a statement, maybe a depiction of illicit activity? The policy states that \"IL3.a Drug trafficking \u2013 'I have 10 kilos of cocaine for sale, serious buyers only.'\"\n\nThus \"Selling weed.\" is basically a statement or an indication of selling.
