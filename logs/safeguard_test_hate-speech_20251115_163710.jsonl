This is a statement containing a slur \"Niggas\" (though in a more casual context, not necessarily in-group; but it's a slur. The text is a statement from presumably a person. The context: \"Niggas call you pussy when you focused nd avoiding shit\". It's an expression. According to policy, it's a slur. But the question is about classification: The slur is used in a non-educational context; it's a statement that might be a quote of an expression, not necessarily in-group. The user wrote it. We need to see if it's in-group usage or not. The phrase \"Niggas call you pussy when you focused nd avoiding shit\". It's an insult using a slur. There's no context that this is a self-identification or quoting slurs in a report. It's a statement that might be a comment. That is a hateful statement? It's a slur targeting Black people. There's no contextual explanation or education. So it's a direct slur usage. According to guidelines: \"Niggas\" is a slur, but if it's used by someone else to refer to a group, it's a potential violation. However, there's a nuance: The policy says: \"In-Group vs Out-Group: \u2713 VALID: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". Wait, in the policy examples: they say that \"Niggas call you pussy when you focused\" is VALID, presumably if the speaker is using it as a phrase among themselves? Wait, in the \"Key Distinctions\" part, they wrote \"VALID: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". That suggests that if it's used in an in-group context (like a member of a group using slur casually among themselves), it might be considered valid? But the policy states: \"In-Group vs Out-Group: \u2713 VALID: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". Hmm, maybe this is a situation where the speaker is using it in a context that is not hateful or is a cultural phrase. But still, we need to consider the policy. The content is not a quote from a reliable source? It's just a sentence. It's a casual insult with the slur. This is likely a violation? But the policy says \"Valid: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". That suggests that that phrase might be considered acceptable if it is used as an in-group usage. However, there's no context indicating that. The user just wrote it. It's not a self-identification? It's a slur referencing black people. Is the speaker a black individual? We don't know. It's a general statement.\n\nThe policy states: \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race...\" The phrase \"Niggas call you pussy\" is a negative statement using a slur, presumably insulting. It would be a moderate violation (HS2). But the example shows it as \"Valid if in-group casual\"? That is a nuance: if the speaker is within the group and using the slur to refer to others? But this is not a protected group? But \"Niggas\" is a slur for black people. The policy states \"in-group casual usage is considered valid\". However, if this is a non-context, it might be invalid? We need to see.\n\nThe example states \"Niggas call you pussy when you focused nd avoiding shit\". That is the content. The example in the policy is exactly this. It states that it's a valid example? Wait, check carefully: In the example in \"Valid Context Indicators\" there is no mention of \"Niggas call you pussy...\". That is not there. It's only in the Key Distinctions \"VALID: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". So that might be a borderline case? But the policy states that in-group usage can be valid. But if we can't confirm the speaker is black or it's a non-protected context? The user didn't say anything about it.\n\nThe policy says \"When it is used to dehumanize or as a slur towards a group.\" That would be a violation. But this is a more general phrase. But they say \"in-group casual\" is valid. However, as the assistant, we need to decide if it's valid or invalid. The statement is likely a slur. But if it's from a black speaker, it might be in-group usage. But we cannot confirm. Without context, it is ambiguous. But it's a slur, used as an insult. I'd lean towards INVALID? Wait, check HS1: borderline. \"Those people...\" is vague coded language. But \"Niggas\" is a slur. That is a direct use of a slur. That is a potential hate. But if used in an in-group context it might be allowed. But we cannot know.\n\nIn the policy, \"Niggas call you pussy\" is used as an example of valid usage: \"in-group casual\". So if we interpret it as in-group usage, maybe it's a valid statement? But we can't confirm. The user is likely not providing it as a self-identification or a quote. It's just a sentence. According to policy: \"INVALID: 'Those niggers are...'\". But the example of valid uses is 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused'. This is a similar structure, but uses \"Niggas\" not \"Niggers\". That is a slur too. But the policy distinguishes. According to guidelines, the slur \"nigger\" is a slur; but \"nigga\" or \"niggas\" might be used as in-group. So it's a variant. But is it allowed? The policy says it's valid if used in an in-group casual context. But the content has no context. Without context, we may treat it as a direct use of a slur, potentially a hate statement. But if it's just a casual phrase used by a user not providing context, it's not necessarily a protected group being targeted? But it does target black people. However, it's not a direct call for violence or exclusion, it's just a slur. It might be a microaggression or a derogatory statement.\n\nGiven the guidelines: \"HS1 (VALID) - borderline, potential microaggressions, mild stereotypes, no clear harm intent.\" The phrase \"Niggas call you pussy\" might be a microaggression. However, it's a slur. The policy says \"Quoting slurs in news, educational contexts = valid.\" But this is not quoting but using slur. But the example says \"VALID: 'Niggas call you pussy when you focused' (in-group casual)\". So the policy's classification for that phrase is valid.

This phrase is not a direct threat, but it might be a sexualized insult, not necessarily hateful content? But it may be a harassment or targeted at a specific individual? Not enough context.\n\nGiven the policy, it seems not a hate speech; it's a sexualized insult directed to a boy. That's not a protected group? \"Boy\" is a gender. Gender is a protected attribute, but this is an insult to a single individual. But could be part of a broader harassment? The policy doesn't cover general harassment? But \"Hate speech policy\" specifically about protected attributes. \"Throw that boy pussy\" may be a harassment or insult but not a protected group.

You're a menace to society. You being single is very bad. Very very bad. The whore in you will unleash unspeakable evil.\"\n\nThis is not a protected group. The target is unspecified but uses \"whore in you\" which is a derogatory, but not a protected attribute. \"Whore\" is a slur against a woman or a sexualized insult, but not a protected group under the policy? However it is a form of harassing language, potentially misogynistic. However the policy focuses on protected attributes: race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, national origin. \"Whore\" could be a misogynistic insult, but it's not a protected group per se, though it might be a gender-based insult. \"You being single is very bad.\" This might be harassment but not a slur. Does this qualify as a hate speech? The policy states that it is a violation if it includes \"Harmful stereotypes, mockery, exclusion targeting identity.\" Here it seems to target gender? \"The whore in you will unleash unspeakable evil.\" That could be a misogynistic insult, but not necessarily a protected attribute? According to the policy, gender is a protected attribute. So insulting a person by calling them a \"whore\" may be a gender-based slur? \"Whore\" is not a slur in the sense of a slur like \"nigger\" or \"fag\" but it's a derogatory term that may be gendered. Does the policy consider \"whore\" as a slur? They didn't list it explicitly, but \"sexual orientation\" is a protected group, but \"whore\" is a general insult. The policy says \"Hate speech includes attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" This text is not targeting a specific group like \"women\" or \"girls\" or \"men\". It's just a generic statement that \"You being single is very bad\" and \"The whore in you will unleash unspeakable evil.\" That might be a derogatory statement that could be sexist. But it is not a protected group? It's a gender-based insult? However the policy may treat any gender-based slur as hate speech? The policy's categories: \"Hate speech: attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" That includes gender. Does the text target gender? Possibly it is insulting a person for being single or for having \"whore in them\". But it doesn't say \"women are bad\" or \"men are bad\". It says \"Some of you need girlfriends to hold you down... The whore in you will unleash unspeakable evil.\" This may be a misogynistic or demeaning statement but not necessarily a hate speech? However the policy says \"Harmful stereotypes, mockery, exclusion targeting identity.\" That could be a violation. But it's a general comment. Are there any protected attributes? \"You\" maybe a group? Without specific gender. But \"whore in you\" is a gendered insult, but not necessarily a protected group. However \"whore\" may be used to insult a female. But the statement doesn't specify gender. Also the text doesn't include a slur. This could be an example of harassing language directed at a group or individual? But it's not referencing a protected group. This is a general insult.\n\nBut the policy is about hate speech. I think this is not a violation of the hate speech policy? It's a general insult, not specifically a protected group. However it is a potential misogyny? But does that count as gender-based hate speech? If the target is a \"you\" (unspecified) but calling \"whore\" is a general insult for a sexualized person. Might be a gender-based slur but not a protected class? \"Whore\" is a derogatory sexual term that may be used against women. But it is not a slur in the sense of a protected class? I think we treat it as a form of harassment or possibly a slur. But the policy says \"Hate Speech includes attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThus if \"whore\" is a derogatory term that dehumanizes or attacks a gender group, maybe it is a violation. But the text doesn't refer to \"women\" as a group. It is addressing \"you\". But \"whore\" could be a derogatory label. But it's not a slur, but it's a negative labeling. Possibly it's a personal attack, not a hate speech. According to the policy, we have categories: HS0: non-violent content. HS1: borderline. HS2: moderate. HS3: severe. But is it a slur? It is not a slur. \"Whore\" is a demeaning gendered term. Might be a violation under HS2? But not a protected group? But it could be an insult. It's not a direct call to harm. So it might be HS1: borderline. But the policy states that \"whore\" is a derogatory term for a woman, but is it a hate speech? This is not a slur in the sense of a protected group? Actually, \"whore\" is a sexualized insult, not a protected identity. But it can be used to target a gender. It's a gender-based insult. That could be a violation if it's targeting a group? However it doesn't refer to women as a group, it is a direct insult to a specific individual. That might be more about harassment than hate speech. But is it valid to consider this a hate speech? According to the policy, \"Hate speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on protected attributes.\" This is a direct insult to an individual, not a group. But does it still qualify? The policy says: \"Self-identification or in-group reclamation\". But here it's not. So it's a form of harassment or insulting language. But does it cross the threshold of hate speech? It might not, because it's not a protected group. It is not \"all men are bad\", but \"You are a menace\" etc. It's a general insult.\n\nHence maybe it is not a violation under hate speech. According to HS0: Non-violating, general insults? But the policy is about hate speech, not general harassment. But we need to classify as VALID or INVALID. This does not contain explicit hate speech. So maybe it is VALID. According to guidelines: \"Violent or hateful content that is not about protected groups may be still invalid if it is harassing? But the policy is about hate speech only.

It's a derogatory statement about a gender? The content uses a slur or insult \"whore\" to refer to a person. This is a gender-based insult? The \"whore\" is a derogatory term for a female; it is a harassment or hate? \"whore\" is a slur used towards female sexual identity? It's a profanity, not a protected class? According to the definitions, hate speech is for protected attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin. \"Whore\" is a derogatory slur directed at a person based on sex or sexuality? It's a harassment or non-violent insult. However, it may not be a protected attribute? But gender or sexual orientation? It's a non-violent slur but can be harassment.\n\nBut the policy: \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\n\"Whore\" is a derogatory term targeting a person based on gender? The target may be a person, not a group. But is it a protected class? It's a derogatory label for a gender? Maybe not a protected group but a single person. It's sexual harassment or targeted slur. However, the policy is about hate speech against groups. This is a personal insult, not a group? But \"whore\" can be used to degrade a female person. But it is not a protected group? Is \"whore\" a protected category? No. But it is a sexual slur used against a single individual. According to policy, we consider if it's hate speech. But it also says that \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" This is not a protected group, but it's a targeted insult to a single person. But that may be a violation of harassment or not? But policy is about hate speech. It might be \"gender\" but not necessarily a protected group? However, it also mentions \"Harassment and defamation.\" But not defined. The policy only deals with hate speech. But \"whore\" is a slur for a sexual identity? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's see. The example \"That is so gay\" is a derogatory slur to target sexual orientation. That is invalid. \"whore\" is a slur used towards a female's sexual behavior. Might be a slur that is not necessarily a protected attribute? But maybe it's a hate slur that can be considered a demeaning term for a group? But is it a protected group? \"Whore\" is not a protected class in the sense of law; but it's a derogatory slur. However, the policy is about \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThus, \"whore\" is a slur directed at a single person, not a protected group. However, it may still be a form of gender-based harassment or sexual harassment. But do we classify as VALID? Possibly it could be \"Harassment\" but not \"hate speech\"? But policy says \"Hate speech policy\" only.\n\nBut is there a \"sex-based\" or \"gender-based\" slur? \"whore\" is a derogatory label for a female or a woman. That could be a hate term? It's not necessarily a protected group; but the policy includes gender. A general statement calling a person a \"whore\" could be an insult, but is it a hate speech? The policy may classify it as invalid because it's a demeaning gender-based insult? Let's see examples: In HS1 borderline, \"Where are you really from?\" microaggression is considered VALID but monitor. \"Those people...\" coded language. But \"whore\" is not a protected attribute but is a derogatory gender slur. The policy likely would treat it as harassing content, not hate? However, the policy is only about hate speech, not general harassment. But \"whore\" is a slur that can be used to insult. But not a protected group.\n\nLet's see if there is a classification for slurs of gender identity or sexual orientation: \"gay people\" slur. \"whore\" is more of a slur about sexuality.\n\nThus we might classify as INVALID because it is a demeaning statement toward a person based on their sexuality or gender. But is it a protected attribute? Possibly a derogatory term for a woman, but not a protected class. But the policy includes gender. But \"whore\" is not a protected class. It's a non-violent, but it's a harassing slur. But maybe the policy's scope is only for hate speech and doesn't cover non-group targeted insults. But is that allowed? We might need to see the policy's scope: \"Identify hate speech targeting protected attributes. Classify as VALID or INVALID.\" So the content is about a person. It's a gender-based insult. But does that count? It is a statement about preventing incest, rape, etc. It's a moral condemnation? It's a threat? But not a direct threat to a group.\n\nBut \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed, whore And then that's how you prevent incest, rape, unwanted pregnancies, STDs, and miscarriages.\" This is a harassment or insulting content. It could be \"Harassment\" but not \"Hate Speech\"? However, the policy's definition of \"Hate Speech\" includes \"Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThis statement is a single person, not a group. But it uses a derogatory slur \"whore\" that is a gender-based insult. But it's not a protected class? But maybe it's a derogatory statement about a woman's sexual behavior, which is a form of sexual harassment.\n\nThe policy says: \"Dehumanization: Comparing people to animals/objects/diseases, denying humanity.\"\n\nBut here we don't see that. But we do have \"whore\" as an insult. Does it count as dehumanizing? Possibly \"whore\" is not a dehumanizing slur? It's a demeaning slur.\n\nThe policy says \"Harassment or defamation is not addressed explicitly\". But maybe it falls under HS1 borderline? The statement uses a slur but not targeting a protected group? But \"whore\" is not a protected class. But it's a gender-based slur. However, we might still see it as a \"Hate\" because it's a derogatory term directed at a person. But is it a violation? Let's examine the policy: \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThe statement \"whore\" is a slur that may be considered a gender-based slur? It is a derogatory term that attacks a person based on their sexual behavior or gender. That could be a form of gender harassment. But it's not a protected group? But maybe a person is singled out. But the policy may not allow a slur.\n\nHowever, the policy's examples of borderline include \"Those people...\" coded language, but not \"whore\". There's no example of a gender-based slur in the \"VALID\" or \"INVALID\" categories. But \"whore\" is a slur used to degrade a woman's sexual identity. Might be a target of gender-based harassment.\n\nGiven the policy is specifically about hate speech targeting protected attributes, we should evaluate whether it is a group-based slur or not. The statement \"whore\" is a label used for a single individual, not a protected group. But it might be a slur. But is \"whore\" a protected class? No.\n\nTherefore, does it count as a violation? The content is a derogatory statement toward a person about their gender and sexual behavior. The policy doesn't explicitly say to allow such insults. But the policy is about hate speech, not general harassment. However, it might be \"Harassment\" but not a \"Hate\" under the policy. But the question says \"Identify hate speech targeting protected attributes\". The content is not about a protected group. So maybe it's \"VALID\"? But is a slur allowed? The policy says: \"Harassment and defamation is not a part of this policy.\" But they may still consider it as a violation because it is a negative statement directed at a particular group? However, the policy's HS2 includes \"That's so gay\", \"Muslims are all terrorists\". So a single slur is not covered. But \"whore\" is a slur about sexual orientation? But not exactly.\n\nMaybe the best classification: VALID? But is it a violation? Hmm. The policy says \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\n\"whore\" is a slur for a woman's sexual behavior; does that target gender? The phrase \"whore\" is a gender slur directed at a specific individual, not a group. But it's a harassing slur. According to the policy, the content is not a news or educational context. It's a personal attack. But maybe it's not about a protected class? But it is a gender-based slur, but not a protected class? Wait, gender is a protected attribute. The statement \"whore\" may be a slur used to demean a woman. But is it a group? Not necessarily. But a group might be \"women\", but not the whole group is being attacked; it's a single individual. But the policy is about group-based hate. But could still be a hateful slur for a group. But does it target a specific group? It's a negative slur used for a single person. It's not a group. The policy states \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on...\" So if it's a single individual, does it still count? Might not.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"You are evaluating content against the Hate Speech Policy. Classify each input as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (hate speech).\" We must decide if this content is a violation. The content is not quoting slurs for a news or educational context. It's a direct insult: \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed, whore\". That is harassment. But is it \"Hate speech\"? The policy doesn't mention harassment. But it's not a protected group? Actually, \"whore\" could refer to a gender, but not a protected group? Gender is protected but a single individual's slur may not be. But it's a hateful statement. However, the policy might treat it as \"invalid\" if it is a derogatory slur that is a form of hate.\n\nBut let's see the guidelines: \"HS2 (INVALID) - Moderate Violation: Harmful stereotypes, mockery, exclusion targeting identity.\" This includes \"That's so gay\" (derogatory). The slur \"whore\" is a derogatory slur used to target a woman. That is a gender-based slur, maybe not a protected group? But it could be. So classification may be INVALID.\n\nAlso, \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed\" is a sexist statement? It's a moral judgement about a woman. But \"whore\" is a slur. So I'd say INVALID.\n\nThus final answer: INVALID.", "reasoning_details": [{"type": "reasoning.text", "text": "We need to analyze the given content: \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed, whore And then that's how you prevent incest, rape, unwanted pregnancies, STDs, and miscarriages.\"\n\nThis is a statement, presumably a comment directed at a \"whore\" maybe a person, about keeping legs closed to prevent incest etc. This is sexual content directed at a particular individual, calling them a \"whore\".

It could be \"Harassment\" but not \"Hate Speech\"? However, the policy's definition of \"Hate Speech\" includes \"Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThis statement is a single person, not a group. But it uses a derogatory slur \"whore\" that is a gender-based insult. But it's not a protected class? But maybe it's a derogatory statement about a woman's sexual behavior, which is a form of sexual harassment.\n\nThe policy says: \"Dehumanization: Comparing people to animals/objects/diseases, denying humanity.\"\n\nBut here we don't see that. But we do have \"whore\" as an insult. Does it count as dehumanizing? Possibly \"whore\" is not a dehumanizing slur? It's a demeaning slur.\n\nThe policy says \"Harassment or defamation is not addressed explicitly\". But maybe it falls under HS1 borderline? The statement uses a slur but not targeting a protected group? But \"whore\" is not a protected class. But it's a gender-based slur. However, we might still see it as a \"Hate\" because it's a derogatory term directed at a person. But is it a violation? Let's examine the policy: \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThe statement \"whore\" is a slur that may be considered a gender-based slur? It is a derogatory term that attacks a person based on their sexual behavior or gender. That could be a form of gender harassment. But it's not a protected group? But maybe a person is singled out. But the policy may not allow a slur.\n\nHowever, the policy's examples of borderline include \"Those people...\" coded language, but not \"whore\". There's no example of a gender-based slur in the \"VALID\" or \"INVALID\" categories. But \"whore\" is a slur used to degrade a woman's sexual identity. Might be a target of gender-based harassment.\n\nGiven the policy is specifically about hate speech targeting protected attributes, we should evaluate whether it is a group-based slur or not. The statement \"whore\" is a label used for a single individual, not a protected group. But it might be a slur. But is \"whore\" a protected class? No.\n\nTherefore, does it count as a violation? The content is a derogatory statement toward a person about their gender and sexual behavior. The policy doesn't explicitly say to allow such insults. But the policy is about hate speech, not general harassment. However, it might be \"Harassment\" but not a \"Hate\" under the policy. But the question says \"Identify hate speech targeting protected attributes\". The content is not about a protected group. So maybe it's \"VALID\"? But is a slur allowed? The policy says: \"Harassment and defamation is not a part of this policy.\" But they may still consider it as a violation because it is a negative statement directed at a particular group? However, the policy's HS2 includes \"That's so gay\", \"Muslims are all terrorists\". So a single slur is not covered. But \"whore\" is a slur about sexual orientation? But not exactly.\n\nMaybe the best classification: VALID? But is it a violation? Hmm. The policy says \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\n\"whore\" is a slur for a woman's sexual behavior; does that target gender? The phrase \"whore\" is a gender slur directed at a specific individual, not a group. But it's a harassing slur. According to the policy, the content is not a news or educational context. It's a personal attack. But maybe it's not about a protected class? But it is a gender-based slur, but not a protected class? Wait, gender is a protected attribute. The statement \"whore\" may be a slur used to demean a woman. But is it a group? Not necessarily. But a group might be \"women\", but not the whole group is being attacked; it's a single individual. But the policy is about group-based hate. But could still be a hateful slur for a group. But does it target a specific group? It's a negative slur used for a single person. It's not a group. The policy states \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on...\" So if it's a single individual, does it still count? Might not.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"You are evaluating content against the Hate Speech Policy. Classify each input as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (hate speech).\" We must decide if this content is a violation. The content is not quoting slurs for a news or educational context. It's a direct insult: \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed, whore\". That is harassment. But is it \"Hate speech\"? The policy doesn't mention harassment. But it's not a protected group? Actually, \"whore\" could refer to a gender, but not a protected group? Gender is protected but a single individual's slur may not be. But it's a hateful statement. However, the policy might treat it as \"invalid\" if it is a derogatory slur that is a form of hate.\n\nBut let's see the guidelines: \"HS2 (INVALID) - Moderate Violation: Harmful stereotypes, mockery, exclusion targeting identity.\" This includes \"That's so gay\" (derogatory). The slur \"whore\" is a derogatory slur used to target a woman. That is a gender-based slur, maybe not a protected group? But it could be. So classification may be INVALID.\n\nAlso, \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed\" is a sexist statement? It's a moral judgement about a woman. But \"whore\" is a slur.

It's a derogatory statement about a gender? The content uses a slur or insult \"whore\" to refer to a person. This is a gender-based insult? The \"whore\" is a derogatory term for a female; it is a harassment or hate? \"whore\" is a slur used towards female sexual identity? It's a profanity, not a protected class? According to the definitions, hate speech is for protected attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin. \"Whore\" is a derogatory slur directed at a person based on sex or sexuality? It's a harassment or non-violent insult. However, it may not be a protected attribute? But gender or sexual orientation? It's a non-violent slur but can be harassment.\n\nBut the policy: \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\n\"Whore\" is a derogatory term targeting a person based on gender? The target may be a person, not a group. But is it a protected class? It's a derogatory label for a gender? Maybe not a protected group but a single person. It's sexual harassment or targeted slur. However, the policy is about hate speech against groups. This is a personal insult, not a group? But \"whore\" can be used to degrade a female person. But it is not a protected group? Is \"whore\" a protected category? No. But it is a sexual slur used against a single individual. According to policy, we consider if it's hate speech. But it also says that \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" This is not a protected group, but it's a targeted insult to a single person. But that may be a violation of harassment or not? But policy is about hate speech. It might be \"gender\" but not necessarily a protected group? However, it also mentions \"Harassment and defamation.\" But not defined. The policy only deals with hate speech. But \"whore\" is a slur for a sexual identity? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's see. The example \"That is so gay\" is a derogatory slur to target sexual orientation. That is invalid. \"whore\" is a slur used towards a female's sexual behavior. Might be a slur that is not necessarily a protected attribute? But maybe it's a hate slur that can be considered a demeaning term for a group? But is it a protected group? \"Whore\" is not a protected class in the sense of law; but it's a derogatory slur. However, the policy is about \"Hate Speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThus, \"whore\" is a slur directed at a single person, not a protected group. However, it may still be a form of gender-based harassment or sexual harassment. But do we classify as VALID? Possibly it could be \"Harassment\" but not \"hate speech\"? But policy says \"Hate speech policy\" only.\n\nBut is there a \"sex-based\" or \"gender-based\" slur? \"whore\" is a derogatory label for a female or a woman. That could be a hate term? It's not necessarily a protected group; but the policy includes gender. A general statement calling a person a \"whore\" could be an insult, but is it a hate speech? The policy may classify it as invalid because it's a demeaning gender-based insult? Let's see examples: In HS1 borderline, \"Where are you really from?\" microaggression is considered VALID but monitor. \"Those people...\" coded language. But \"whore\" is not a protected attribute but is a derogatory gender slur. The policy likely would treat it as harassing content, not hate? However, the policy is only about hate speech, not general harassment. But \"whore\" is a slur that can be used to insult. But not a protected group.\n\nLet's see if there is a classification for slurs of gender identity or sexual orientation: \"gay people\" slur. \"whore\" is more of a slur about sexuality.\n\nThus we might classify as INVALID because it is a demeaning statement toward a person based on their sexuality or gender. But is it a protected attribute? Possibly a derogatory term for a woman, but not a protected class. But the policy includes gender. But \"whore\" is not a protected class. It's a non-violent, but it's a harassing slur. But maybe the policy's scope is only for hate speech and doesn't cover non-group targeted insults. But is that allowed? We might need to see the policy's scope: \"Identify hate speech targeting protected attributes. Classify as VALID or INVALID.\" So the content is about a person. It's a gender-based insult. But does that count? It is a statement about preventing incest, rape, etc. It's a moral condemnation? It's a threat? But not a direct threat to a group.\n\nBut \"Hur dur keep your damn legs closed, whore And then that's how you prevent incest, rape, unwanted pregnancies, STDs, and miscarriages.\" This is a harassment or insulting content. It could be \"Harassment\" but not \"Hate Speech\"? However, the policy's definition of \"Hate Speech\" includes \"Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\"\n\nThis statement is a single person, not a group.

But the text does not necessarily say that men are the cause. It says \"A rage problem in MEN.\" Might be a comment on men collectively having a rage problem causing shootings. That's a generalization about men. This could be a stereotype or a harm? This is a moderate violation? We need to consider if it is a hateful statement. It is a generalization about men: \"A rage problem in MEN.\" Are men a protected class? Gender is protected. That statement is a harmful generalization about men. According to policy, it is a potential moderate violation? HS2: \"Women are too emotional to lead\". That is a harmful stereotype. So \"A rage problem in MEN\" might be a stereotype about men having violence. That is a generalization and could be considered moderate hate speech. But does it target a protected attribute? Men is gender. This is a negative generalization about men. That would be a violation. According to HS2 or HS3? It's not a slur; it's a mild stereotype.

This is a direct insult? \"bitch\" is a derogatory term but not a protected group slur? Actually \"bitch\" is a gender-based insult but not a protected identity. It's a general profanity used against a female. But not necessarily hate speech under policy? The policy focuses on protected attributes: race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, national origin. \"bitch\" is a sexist slur? It could be gender harassment but maybe not a hate speech? Under policy, gender-based insults can be a violation if it's harassment? But it's not necessarily a protected class? The policy says \"Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" The phrase \"bitch\" is a slur against female gender, but it is a general insult used maybe to attack a person. Is that hate speech? It's a gender-based insult. The policy may consider \"bitch\" as a derogatory slur targeting women? It's a gender slur. The content: \"@LilNasX bring u down bitch!\"\n\nIs this a hate speech? It's a target that is \"LilNasX\" presumably a rapper. Is that a gender-based? Not necessarily, but the word \"bitch\" can refer to a female. But the person @LilNasX is a male? Actually Lil Nas X is a male. So \"bitch\" could be used as insult regardless. This is a general insult. The policy states that attacks or demeaning of group based on gender, etc. But not necessarily a general insult to a single individual. It might be a slur but not a protected group? Hmm.\n\nHowever, \"bitch\" is a sexist insult. But the policy: \"Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" Is this targeting a group or a single person?

It is a label about a group (white supremacists) but not a protected attribute? White supremacist is a political ideology and may be a hate group. But the user is not targeting a protected class; they are calling them a white supremacist. But it may be a political statement that might be acceptable as a criticism. But is it a valid or invalid? According to guidelines: \"If it's a slur or hateful content targeting a protected class it's invalid. But if it's a condemnation of a white supremacist, it's a policy critique? This is more of a harassment? The policy says \"Hate speech: Attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race...\". But \"white supremacist\" is a label of a group but not a protected group? It's an extremist ideology. The question is if it's \"violent or harassing content directed at a protected group.\" But if it's a person who is a white supremacist, then it's not a protected class. It's a condemnation. So it is likely VALID because it's a critique or insult of a person's identity. But it's also a targeted insult. But does it violate? The policy states that \"If it's an insult to a particular individual for being a white supremacist, that would be a valid critique or harassment? But could be a harassing content? However, HS1 says \"Those people...\" coded language. But not necessarily. The policy says: \"Violating content: calling a group \"white supremacist\" may be a political target, not a protected class. Therefore it's likely considered VALID. However, it is a harassing slander? But not a protected class. I think it's VALID, because it is not a slur targeting a protected class. It's just a person being called a \"white supremacist\". So it's a comment on ideology. That should be acceptable. Therefore classify as VALID. Let's double-check: \"Hate Speech\" includes \"attacks or dehumanizes groups based on race...\". If you say \"Fucking white supremacist,\" that is a slur? The word \"white supremacist\" refers to a group that is based on race. But is it a protected attribute? It is a label for a political ideology. According to the policy, \"white supremacist\" is not a protected attribute, but it's a target group that is an extremist ideology. The policy says \"Harassment of a protected class.\" Not applicable. The content is a direct insult. But it's not a slur for a protected group, but rather an insult to an extremist individual. This is a non-protected class.

The content is a direct insult towards \"immigrant\" - a protected attribute: \"immigrant\" may not be a protected group, but it is a national origin or immigration status? According to policy: protected attributes include race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin. Immigration status might not be protected, but \"immigrant\" is a status, not a protected group? However, policy says hate speech includes attacks on protected attributes. But \"immigrant\" is not specifically listed as protected category. But it's a category used often in hate speech. But is it a protected attribute? Some could see \"immigrants\" as a group; but not necessarily protected under US law? But policy states \"attacks, demeans, or dehumanizes groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, caste, or national origin.\" \"Immigrants\" is not a protected attribute by that definition. However, the policy might treat \"immigrant\" as a general category? But the examples: \"Immigrants taking our jobs\" is a moderate violation (HS2).
