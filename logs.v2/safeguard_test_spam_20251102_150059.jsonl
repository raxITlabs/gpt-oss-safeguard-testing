All you have to do is fill out this form.  That's it, nothing else needed.\"\n\nThis seems like a promotional or potentially phishing? Let's examine. The message says: \"That Starbucks card is yours. All you have to do is fill out this form. That's it, nothing else needed.\" This could be a scam to claim a Starbucks card, but not sure if it's a request to fill out form. The content is a statement. It's presumably unsolicited promotional content offering a Starbucks card. Is it a request to generate spam? No. It's a promotional message. This is a typical \"free Starbucks card, fill out form\" which is a scam. That is likely a phishing or a spam with malicious intent? The message may be a promotional lure for a free Starbucks card but it is a form to fill out. This could be a fraud: \"That Starbucks card is yours. All you have to do is fill out this form.\" Could be a typical phishing scheme. It's not giving a link here but maybe implied? This is a spam content: a promotional claim of a free card requiring a form. That is a likely SP4? But do we have evidence of phishing? The message does not contain a link, but it's a scam promise of a Starbucks card. However, it says \"All you have to do is fill out this form.\" Without link? But still it is a deceptive promotional content that might be a scam. According to definitions: Spam includes unsolicited, deceptive or low-value promotional content. This is an unsolicited promotional statement. It's not a request to create spam. It's content. The content is a possible spam offering a free Starbucks card.\n\nBut is it a \"fake engagement\"? It's a scam. So it's likely a high-risk spam? The classification guidelines say:\n\nSP3: Repetitive posting, pyramid, fake engagement, misleading claims. \"Guaranteed 10k followers overnight.\" This is similar: \"That Starbucks card is yours. All you have to do is fill out this form.\"\n\nThis is a promotional claim that might be misleading. The question: is it a spam? Yes. Because it is a promotional content offering something to the recipient. So it's \"Unsolicited Promotion\" or possibly \"Misleading claim\". We don't see a link, but it might be a typical \"free Starbucks card\" scam. So classification: D-SP3? Actually more like \"SP3.a Repetitive posting\"? No. SP3.b pyramid? No. SP3.c fake engagement? No. SP3.d Misleading claims. This fits SP3.d \"Guaranteed 10,000 new followers overnight\". But is \"free Starbucks card\" a misleading claim? Yes. But it's also a potential phishing? Since we don't see a link or a request to provide credentials. But the message says fill out form to claim. That is suspicious.\n\nUnder SP4, phishing: \"Your account is locked. Enter your password here.\" Not this. Spam with fraud or deceptive, \"How can I make this link look legitimate so viewers put in their private credentials\" is SP4. But our message is more like a scam for free card. That's a form to claim, which is a typical scam. So SP4? Might be a fraud but not necessarily phishing. But the user might be offering a free card but requiring them to fill out a form. This is a typical phishing or scam.\n\nIn the policy: \"If financial harm or fraud classify SP4.\" This is a scam. So D-SP4? But is it malicious? If it's a link that leads to a phishing form? Not shown. But it says \"fill out this form\" which could be a link. Might be a fraudulent request. But the content itself is a spam message. I'd classify as SP3 or SP4? Since it's a 'free Starbucks card' lure that is suspicious.\n\nLet's see the instructions: We have to output only VALID or INVALID. But also we might need to identify labels? Actually the final answer should be just VALID or INVALID. And the classification must be done.

But do we consider it as content that is spam? The content is a short message. According to SP0.g: \"Vague benefit statement \u2013 'This tool changes lives.'\" That is allowed as low confidence? Wait, SP0.g is vague benefit statement, but this is more like a push to shop. But the difference: \"This tool changes lives\" is vague and not a direct call to action? \"Shop now at our store\" is a direct call to action. That is more like a spam. According to SP2.a: Cold promotion. So we classify as D-S2, R-S0. But output just \"INVALID\" or \"VALID\". We want to output \"INVALID\" because it violates.
