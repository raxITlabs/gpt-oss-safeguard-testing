Input: \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon?  This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\". This is a promotional statement for a site shop.shop.ca. It's a single promotional message. The user is presumably just sending a message. Is this unsolicited? Hard to know context, but it's a promotional statement about a site, not necessarily a request or part of a conversation. But per rules, a single promotional statement is considered VALID unless there's spam indicators like multiple messages or repeated. The example in SP0: \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" is single promotional message and considered VALID. However, that example had \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" no link. But our message includes a link: shop.shop.ca. But that's fine. The definition says: \"Promotional language WITHOUT unsolicited/bulk indicators\" is VALID. But is it unsolicited? The question says \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon? This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\". That seems like unsolicited advertising. But maybe it's a personal message? Not enough context. However, the policy states \"Spam requires UNSOLICITED + (BULK or REPETITIVE or DECEPTIVE)\". Here we have a single message. There's no evidence of bulk or repetitive. It's just a single message. So it's probably VALID as it's a single promotional statement.\n\nBut could be a cold promo. The example under SP2: \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\". That is similar: a promotional link with no context. That was labeled INVALID because it's a cold promo. Hmm. The difference between SP0 and SP2: SP0 includes \"Join our newsletter for weekly tips and exclusive offers.\" That is a legitimate opt-in? Wait SP0 includes \"Join our newsletter for weekly tips and exclusive offers.\" But SP2 includes \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" which is a cold promo.\n\nBut what's the difference? The SP0 examples are general context. But the SP0 examples say \"Promotional language WITHOUT unsolicited/bulk indicators\" is VALID. However, \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" is a single promotional link; it is unsolicited? Might be considered a single promotional statement but it's also a link to a specific site. That seems like a cold promotion.\n\nBut is \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon? This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\" similar to a cold promo? Yes, it's recommending a site. There is no context of a prior request or a conversation. So it may be a spam message. But is there any evidence of a bulk? We can't see that. The policy says: \"When uncertain, default to VALID.\" But we should evaluate.\n\nLet's see difference between SP0 and SP2 definitions:\n\n- SP0: Non-Spam; useful, contextual, or legitimate communication; legitimate marketing without bulk/unsolicited. Example includes \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" That's a promotional statement but presumably from someone who has a context, maybe a business or brand. But not necessarily a cold. Hmm.\n\nThe difference might be whether the message is a part of a conversation or not. But we don't know.\n\nIn many contexts, a single promotional message that doesn't request the recipient to sign up might still be spam if unsolicited. However, the policy states: \"Spam requires UNSOLICITED + (BULK or REPETITIVE or DECEPTIVE). Single promotional statements without spam indicators are VALID.\"\n\nBut does unsolicited still count? The statement \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon?  This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\" is a cold, unsolicited promotional content. However, it doesn't contain repetitive or bulk. According to guidelines, if it's a single message, it might be considered VALID. But examples of SP2 also are single but still considered spam? Wait SP2 example \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" is also a single message, and it's labelled INVALID because it's a cold promotion with no context. But they say \"Unsolicited promotion without clear deception.\" That would be a spam.\n\nThus difference: The SP0 example \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" could be a legitimate marketing message that maybe is part of an email marketing campaign but maybe is a single message? But it says \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" That is a single promotional statement but could be a legitimate marketing message within a context where the recipient has opted in. The \"Join our newsletter...\" is also a context. The \"Check out my Shopify course\" is not part of a context.\n\nThus we need to see if the message is a context? The question \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon?\" might be a marketing attempt to promote shop.shop.ca. That could be a cold outreach. That would be spam. But maybe it's a casual suggestion. But the presence of a link suggests it is promotional. According to SP2: \"Unsolicited promotion without clear deception\" is spam.\n\nThus likely label: INVALID (spam). But we must see if it's not too repetitive or deceptive. So it's SP2.

Wait SP0 includes \"Join our newsletter for weekly tips and exclusive offers.\" But SP2 includes \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" which is a cold promo.\n\nBut what's the difference? The SP0 examples are general context. But the SP0 examples say \"Promotional language WITHOUT unsolicited/bulk indicators\" is VALID. However, \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" is a single promotional link; it is unsolicited? Might be considered a single promotional statement but it's also a link to a specific site. That seems like a cold promotion.\n\nBut is \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon? This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\" similar to a cold promo? Yes, it's recommending a site. There is no context of a prior request or a conversation. So it may be a spam message. But is there any evidence of a bulk? We can't see that. The policy says: \"When uncertain, default to VALID.\" But we should evaluate.\n\nLet's see difference between SP0 and SP2 definitions:\n\n- SP0: Non-Spam; useful, contextual, or legitimate communication; legitimate marketing without bulk/unsolicited. Example includes \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" That's a promotional statement but presumably from someone who has a context, maybe a business or brand. But not necessarily a cold. Hmm.\n\nThe difference might be whether the message is a part of a conversation or not. But we don't know.\n\nIn many contexts, a single promotional message that doesn't request the recipient to sign up might still be spam if unsolicited. However, the policy states: \"Spam requires UNSOLICITED + (BULK or REPETITIVE or DECEPTIVE). Single promotional statements without spam indicators are VALID.\"\n\nBut does unsolicited still count? The statement \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon?  This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\" is a cold, unsolicited promotional content. However, it doesn't contain repetitive or bulk. According to guidelines, if it's a single message, it might be considered VALID. But examples of SP2 also are single but still considered spam? Wait SP2 example \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\" is also a single message, and it's labelled INVALID because it's a cold promotion with no context. But they say \"Unsolicited promotion without clear deception.\" That would be a spam.\n\nThus difference: The SP0 example \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" could be a legitimate marketing message that maybe is part of an email marketing campaign but maybe is a single message? But it says \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" That is a single promotional statement but could be a legitimate marketing message within a context where the recipient has opted in. The \"Join our newsletter...\" is also a context. The \"Check out my Shopify course\" is not part of a context.\n\nThus we need to see if the message is a context? The question \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon?\" might be a marketing attempt to promote shop.shop.ca. That could be a cold outreach. That would be spam. But maybe it's a casual suggestion. But the presence of a link suggests it is promotional. According to SP2: \"Unsolicited promotion without clear deception\" is spam.\n\nThus likely label: INVALID (spam). But we must see if it's not too repetitive or deceptive. So it's SP2.

Hard to know context, but it's a promotional statement about a site, not necessarily a request or part of a conversation. But per rules, a single promotional statement is considered VALID unless there's spam indicators like multiple messages or repeated. The example in SP0: \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" is single promotional message and considered VALID. However, that example had \"New product launch\u2014check it out!\" no link.

The question says \"Who is to say that you need to do all your shopping on Amazon? This new site offers even better deal shop.shop.ca\". That seems like unsolicited advertising.
