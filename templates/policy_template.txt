[Category Name] Policy (#[ABBREV])
GOAL: Identify [category]. Classify each EXAMPLE as VALID (no violation) or INVALID (violation) using this policy.

DEFINITIONS
[Primary Violation]: [Clear, concise definition of the main violation type]

[Key Concept 1]: [Definition of important concept related to violations]

[Key Concept 2]: [Definition of context or scope]

[Key Concept 3]: [Definition of harm or intent]

✅ Allowed Content ([ABBREV]0 – Non-violating or very low confidence signals)
Content that is acceptable, contextual, or non-violating. May appear concerning but is legitimate.

[ABBREV]0.a [Subcategory name] – "[Example of allowed content]"

[ABBREV]0.b [Subcategory name] – "[Example of allowed content]"

[ABBREV]0.c [Subcategory name] – "[Example of allowed content]"

[ABBREV]0.d [Subcategory name] – "[Example of allowed content]"

[ABBREV]0.e [Subcategory name] – "[Example of allowed content]"

✅ Output: VALID - clearly non-violating or very low confidence signals content could violate.

🚫 Likely Violation ([ABBREV]2 – Medium Confidence)
[Description of medium severity violations - clear policy violations but lower harm]

[ABBREV]2.a [Subcategory name] – "[Example of medium violation]"

[ABBREV]2.b [Subcategory name] – "[Example of medium violation]"

[ABBREV]2.c [Subcategory name] – "[Example of medium violation]"

❌ Output: INVALID

❗ High-Risk Violation ([ABBREV]3 – Strong Confidence)
[Description showing scaling, severity, or aggressive tactics]

[ABBREV]3.a [Subcategory name] – "[Example of high-risk violation]"

[ABBREV]3.b [Subcategory name] – "[Example of high-risk violation]"

[ABBREV]3.c [Subcategory name] – "[Example of high-risk violation]"

[ABBREV]3.d [Subcategory name] – "[Example of high-risk violation]"

❌ Output: INVALID

🚨 Severe Violation ([ABBREV]4 – Maximum Severity)
[Description of most harmful violations with serious consequences]

[ABBREV]4.a [Subcategory name] – "[Example of severe violation]"

[ABBREV]4.b [Subcategory name] – "[Example of severe violation]"

[ABBREV]4.c [Subcategory name] – "[Example of severe violation]"

❌ Output: INVALID + ESCALATE

LABEL FORMAT
Each item gets two labels:
Depiction (D-[ABBREV]#): Presence of violation in content.
Request (R-[ABBREV]#): User asking to generate violating content.

| Example | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| "[Example showing depicted violation]" | D-[ABBREV]2, R-[ABBREV]0 |
| "[Example showing request to create violation]" | D-[ABBREV]0, R-[ABBREV]2 |
| "[Example showing both depiction and request]" | D-[ABBREV]4, R-[ABBREV]4 |

AMBIGUITY & ESCALATION
If unclear → downgrade severity by 1 and seek clarification.
If harm is imminent or severe → classify [ABBREV]4.
If combined with other indicators of abuse, violence, or illicit behavior → apply highest severity policy.

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Return exactly one word: VALID or INVALID.
Do not include any explanation or punctuation.

VALID = Content does NOT violate this policy.
INVALID = Content violates this policy.
