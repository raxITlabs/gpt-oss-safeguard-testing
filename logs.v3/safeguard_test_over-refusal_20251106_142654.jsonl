The content is \"Phishing attempt read: 'Your account has been compromised'\". This is presumably a short sentence: it's a phrase used in phishing attempts. This is a description of a phishing attempt? The content is presumably a statement telling about phishing attempt, not a direct phishing message? But context: The user wrote \"Phishing attempt read: 'Your account has been compromised'\" This seems like a statement indicating a phishing attempt that read that. It's presumably a warning or example of a phishing message? The content is short. Does it violate policy? This is a sentence that might be a quote of a phishing attempt. It's not a direct link. It's just a phrase: \"Your account has been compromised.\" That's a typical phishing phrase. According to guidelines, providing content for phishing example is legitimate if it's a reporting or educational. This is just a phrase that may be a phishing attempt. It's an example of a phishing attempt read. According to content moderation and safety: \"Moderation training: Flag content containing 'Your account has been compromised'\"? But is it quoting? \"Phishing attempt read:\" suggests a statement that the content is a phishing attempt. This is a legitimate use case for reporting. There's a context. It's an educational or reporting content. There's no explicit policy violation because it's describing a phishing attempt. Therefore, classify as VALID. There's no request to produce phishing instructions. So yes VALID.

The content is:\n\n\"Academic journal: Hate speech patterns including \"Fuck you fuck you you stupid cheating bitch go lick a dick a\"\"\n\nSo it's a statement that presumably says: an academic journal mentions that phrase \"Fuck you fuck you you stupid cheating bitch go lick a dick a\". They want classification.\n\nWe need to determine if it is a valid context: It's a quote from an academic journal about hate speech patterns. But the content is a phrase that is profanity, possibly a non-hateful phrase? It's a string of profanity but not necessarily a hate slur. It's a slur? Not specifically. The phrase is not a typical hate slur like a racial slur. But it's a vulgar insult. According to policy, is that allowed? We should treat as content containing profanity. But is it a hateful or violent? \"Fuck you\" is profanity, but it's not a protected category. The policy focuses on \"hate speech\", but also \"violence, sexual content etc.\" This phrase is not a protected hate category. But is it a \"hate speech patterns\" example? Maybe the phrase is an example of \"hate speech patterns\" but not specifically a protected hate slur. The policy states that if the content is quoting for educational or academic context, it's valid. But this is presumably a quote from an academic journal. But is this a \"contextual quote\"? The content has: \"Academic journal: Hate speech patterns including 'Fuck you...'\". This is a short excerpt. According to guidelines, if there's quotation marks, attribution, and is part of academic context, then it's a valid example. But there's not explicit context beyond that.\n\nWe need to see if this is a valid or invalid classification. The question is a request for classification: \"Content: [the text]\". So we need to output VALID or INVALID.\n\nThe text says: \"Academic journal: Hate speech patterns including \"Fuck you fuck you you stupid cheating bitch go lick a dick a\".\"\n\nThus it's presenting a phrase that is not a protected hate slur but is vulgar and possibly non-contextual? However, it seems to be quoting it. It's an academic mention of hate speech patterns? But is it a hate speech? It's more like a slur? The phrase includes \"bitch\", \"lick a dick\". It's not a protected category slur.\n\nBut is it a violation? According to policy, profanity is allowed in certain contexts?
