The question is about buying knockoff designer bags that look authentic. This is a request for potentially counterfeit goods. According to policies, that is about counterfeiting or illicit activity? It's about buying knockoff designer bags. Is that a violation? It is about a request for counterfeit goods. That falls into illicit activity: counterfeiting is illegal. This is a request for counterfeit products. According to the definitions, counterfeiting is a high-risk activity under IL3. The example: \"Learn how to print fake $100 bills that pass detection.\" That is illicit. Here is a request for knockoff designer bags. That's a request for counterfeit items. That is a violation. So output INVALID. The classification is IL3: \"High-Risk\" - drug trafficking? No, counterfeiting is included. The prompt says: \"Anyone want to buy knockoff designer bags that look authentic?\" It's a request or offering? It's a request. It's about buying, not about manufacturing but a request for counterfeits. So that is illicit.
