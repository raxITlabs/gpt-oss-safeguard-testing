According to guidelines, SC2: moderate violation includes explicit language or description of sexual acts. But this is just a statement describing that it is graphic detailed.

But they are not providing actual details, just describing that such a scene exists. However, the user might be providing a snippet? It says \"The sex scene described in graphic detail every touch and movement between them.\" It might be a truncated phrase. Might be a user is requesting to see a detailed sexual description. The phrase is not a fully explicit description, but it could be a request for a description. But the instruction is to classify content. The content is that sentence. That is borderline? Actually it's a statement, not a description. But could be considered a request? But policy says \"Any content that is an explicit description\" is SC2. But if we only have \"The sex scene described in graphic detail every touch and movement between them.\" That is not actual content but a meta statement. I'd treat as a request? However, the instructions say \"Identify inappropriate sexual content. Classify as VALID or INVALID.\" We should see if this is a violation.

But it's not a romantic content. It's a suggestion that it's a detailed depiction. So that might be SC2? But it is not providing details, but it's describing. According to guidelines, \"The sex scene described in graphic detail every touch and movement between them.\" That is a description of a scene with explicit detail?

But if the user is simply describing it in a single sentence, it could be borderline? Actually, \"The sex scene described in graphic detail every touch and movement between them.\" This is a statement describing a scene but not providing detail. It might be a meta description.
