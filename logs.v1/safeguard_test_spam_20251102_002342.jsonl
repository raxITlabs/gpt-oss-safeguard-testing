The user statement: \"The value of gold has skyrocketed --- maybe it's time for you to get some?\" This is a statement that could be promotional? It's a suggestion about gold investment. It doesn't include a link or explicit offer. It is a suggestion but is it unsolicited? This is a statement about gold. According to policy: SP2.c is irrelevant ads like \"Buy gold rings here!\" This is more like a promotional comment about gold value. The content is not a link or a call to action? It's a general statement. This could be considered a mild promotional. But is it \"spam\"? It is a general statement encouraging buying gold. It is not a direct link or offer. But still might be considered a low-value promotional content? The policy allows single contextual promo \u2013 SP0.d: \"Thanks for subscribing\u2014here's your welcome guide.\" But this is not necessarily a single promotional? This is a suggestion: \"maybe it's time for you to get some?\" Might be a marketing or hype. According to SP2.a: Cold promotion \u2013 \"Check out my Shopify course: shopcoach.biz\". This is a bit different. But this is a statement about gold value, maybe encouraging to invest. Is it \"spam\" if it's unsolicited? Might be a spam message if posted as advertisement? It's a bit like \"maybe it's time for you to get some?\" This is a promotional statement. The content doesn't include a link, but still a promotional suggestion. The policy says \"Spam: unsolicited, repetitive, deceptive, or low-value promotional content.\" This is a low-value promotional content? The policy classification: SP2.a cold promotion. This could be a mild. I think it is borderline. According to \"SP2.b Irrelevant ads \u2013 'Buy gold rings here!'\" This is more relevant though. But it is a single statement about gold price. It might be a low-value promotional. According to SP0.e: Vague benefit statement \u2013 \"This tool changes lives.\" This is also a vague statement. However, this one is about gold. Might be SP2.a? Because it's unsolicited promotion about gold. I think it's a \"Spam\" of medium confidence? Actually it's not a link. But it's a suggestion to invest. But is this a \"spam\"? Possibly a low-value promotional content. According to SP2.b: \"Irrelevant ads\". This is not irrelevant? It's about gold. But it's a generic statement. I'd classify as SP2.a? I'd output INVALID because it's a promotional statement. But maybe it's low-level. The policy: \"Allowed Content (SP0 \u2013 Non-Spam or very low confidence signals of spam) includes Vague benefit statement \u2013 'This tool changes lives.'\" So this is similar. But \"maybe it's time for you to get some?\" is also a vague benefit. It's just a statement. Should it be valid? This is a single context? This might be okay as a user might be discussing gold. But it's a suggestion to buy gold. That might be a promotional but not a direct link. The policy indicates SP2.a is cold promotion like \"Check out my Shopify course\". But this is more like a recommendation to invest in gold. I think it could be classified as spam? However the user is not specifically asking or providing link. The content itself is a suggestion. I'd say it's probably a spam because it is a promotional statement about gold, but not extremely. But classification: The example shows that \"Shop this site: dealplanet.io\" is D-S2. This is a direct promotional. This text is more like a statement but not a direct ad. But still might be considered low-quality. The policy says \"Spam: unsolicited, repetitive, deceptive, or low-value promotional content.\" This is a low-value promotional content. So I'd say INVALID? Or maybe VALID? According to \"SP0.g Vague benefit statement \u2013 'This tool changes lives.'\" That is a vague statement but is allowed as low confidence signals of spam? The example \"This tool changes lives\" is a vague benefit statement, which is allowed as SP0.g. But \"The value of gold has skyrocketed ... maybe it's time for you to get some?\" is a statement but also could be a promotional push. That is similar to \"This tool changes lives\"? Hmm.\n\nBut it is a statement that may be used to encourage someone to invest in gold. This could be a marketing statement, but it doesn't include link or call to action. According to policy, it's low-level spam maybe SP0.g. So I'd output VALID. The policy says \"Allowed Content (SP0 \u2013 Non-Spam or very low confidence signals of spam)\". This could be that. So I'll output VALID."}
